# bookbase

## Introduction

These are the shared files in my book and teaching material building projects.
The files, bibliography, and scripts in this repository are used by several of my writing and teaching projects, including:

- [Programming with Python](https://thomasweise.github.io/programmingWithPython)
- [Databases](https://thomasweise.github.io/databases)
- [Talks](https://thomasweise.github.io/talks)

The repository offers LaTeX styles for books and slides&nbsp;(with background photos taken from our university), glossary support, my personal bibliography, scripts for compiling books and slides to PDF and to minify those PDFs, listings, support for including files from other `git` repositories&nbsp;(via [`texgit`](https://thomasweise.github.io/software/textgit)), support for Python code and virtual environments, and many more utilities.
These are all designed particularly as foundation for my personal projects, tailored to our uni, and so on.
However, there might be bits and pieces of code useful for others in here as well.
