In a \gls{clientServerArchitecture}, the \gls{client} is a device or process that requests a service from the \gls{server}. %
It initiates the communication with the \gls{server}, sends a request, and receives the response with the result of the request. %

These requests and responses are usually sent over network connections. %
A typical example for such a system is the \gls{WWW}, where web \glspl{server} host websites and make them available to web browsers, the \glspl{client}. %
Another typical example is the structure of \gls{db} software, where a central \gls{server}, the \pgls{dbms}, offers access to the \gls{db} to the different \glspl{client}. %
Here, the \gls{client} can be some \gls{terminal} software shipping with the \pgls{dbms}, such as \psql, or the different applications that access the \glspl{db}.%

\emph{doctests} are \pglspl{unitTest} in the form of as small pieces of code in the \glspl{docstring} that look like interactive \python\ sessions.
The first line of a statement in such a \python\ snippet is indented with \python{>>>}\pythonIdx{>\strut>\strut>} and the following lines by \pythonil{...}\pythonIdx{\idxdots}.
These snippets can be executed by modules like \pythonilIdx{doctest}~\cite{PSF:P3D:TPSL:DTIPE} or tools such as \pytest~\cite{KPDT2024PD:HTRD}.

\newglossaryentry{exitCode}{%
name={exit code},%
description={%
When a process terminates, it can return a single integer value~(the exit status code) to indicate success or failure~\cite{J2024PTOGBSI8IS12E:TAP}. %
Per convention, an exit code of~0 means success. %
Any non-zero exit code indicates an error. %
Under \python, you can terminate the current process at any time by calling \pythonilIdx{exit} and optionally passing in the exit code that should be returned. %
If \pythonilIdx{exit} is not explicitly called, then the interpreter will return an exit code of~0 once the process normally terminates.%
If the process was terminated by an uncaught \pythonilIdx{Exception}, a non-zero exit code, usually~1, is returned.%

\newglossaryentry{exponent}{%

description={%
The exponent is the part of a floating point number that stores a power of~2 with which the \gls{significand} is multiplied. %

In the 64~bit double precision IEEE~Standard 754 floating point number layout~\cite{IEEE2019ISFFPA,H1997IS7FPN}, the exponent is 11~bits with a \gls{bias} of~1023.%

\newglossaryentry{locale}{%
name={locale},%
description={%
A \gls{locale} corresponds basically to a selection of country or culture for a system or application~\cite{J2024PTOGBSI8IS12E:L}. %
The \gls{locale} then determines a set of country- or culture-dependent settings, such as the text representation for money or dates, or what decimal separators are used.%
A good example is, for example, that American English readers will interpret the date~7/4/2000 as July~4th, 2000, whereas British English readers will read this as the 7th~of April, 2000~\cite{CDE:D}. %
It is therefore important that software printing dates knows whether it is running on an American or British English~PC.%

The \glspl{client} connect to the network address and \gls{port} number of the \gls{server} to establish such connections. %
\gls{port} numbers range from~0 to~65535, where the \gls{port} numbers from~0 to~1023 are so-called well-known ports corresponding to the most common services, e.g., \gls{HTTP}, the protocol underpinning of the \gls{WWW}, uses normally port~80.%

This column is usually annotated as \sqlil{NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP}\sqlIdx{CURRENT\_TIMESTAMP}~\cite{PGDG:PD:DTFAO}, meaning that the \dbms\ will automatically store the current date and time when a row is created. %

\python\ is a dynamically typed programming language where you do not need to specify the type of, e.g., a variable. %
This creates problems for code analysis, both automated as well as manual: %
For example, it may not always be clear whether a variable or function parameter should be an integer or floating point number. %
The annotations allow us to explicitly state which type is expected. %

\newglossaryentry{unitTest}{%
name={unit test},%
description={%
Software development is centered around creating the program code of an application, library, or otherwise useful system. %
A \emph{unit test} is an \emph{additional} code fragment that is not part of that productive code. %
It exists to execute~(a part of) the productive code in a certain scenario~(e.g., with specific parameters), to observe the behavior of that code, and to compare whether this behavior meets the specification~\cite{P2021PUTAAOAEUTIP,R2006ASOUTP,TLG2006UTCU}. %
If not, the unit test fails. %
The use of unit tests is at least threefold: %
First, they help us to detect errors in the code. %
Second, program code is usually not developed only once and, from then on, used without change indefinitely. %
Instead, programs are often updated, improved, extended, and maintained over a long time. %
Unit tests can help us to detect whether such changes in the program code, maybe after years, violate the specification or, maybe, cause another, depending, module of the program to violate its specification.
Third, they are part of the documentation or even specification of a program.%
